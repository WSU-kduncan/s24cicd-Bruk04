CI Project Overview
I am building a docker container, that will host and contain a website that I installed/edited


Run Project Locally:

how to install docker + dependencies (WSL2, for example)
how to build an image from the Dockerfile
how to run the container
how to view the project running in the container (open a browser...go to IP and port...)
